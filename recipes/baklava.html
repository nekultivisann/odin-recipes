    <p>Baklava s a layered pastry dessert made of filo pastry, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tabelspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cinammon stick</li>

    <h2>How to make BAKLAVA</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions
         (this is best done overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting your recipe to bring it to room temp).</li>
         <li>Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking sheet. My phyllo dough package had 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets that measured 9×14 so I had to trim them slightly.
         You can trim one stack at a time then cover with a damp towel to keep from drying out.</li>
         <li> Butter the bottom and sides of a 13×9 non-stick baking pan.</li>
         <li>Bake</li>
         <li>Cut</li>
    </ol>
