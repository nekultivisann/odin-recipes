This is first web page I ever created. As it seems, everything went well. At begging, It wasn`t going how I wanted. 
While making index.html it was fun, but I had few questions, how to do this, or to do that.
After I made first page for recipes, called Baklava, everything from that point went pretty well fast and without any problems.
On my second recipe page, called Cevap, it was really smooth, I didn`t make any mistake, and I finished it in no time.
I felt really uncomfortable at starting this project, but at the end of it, it felt remarkable and so lightening.
At the end, I conlcuded that it needs to be boring and uncomfortable at begining, like doing everything new, but reward will come sooner than you hope so,just focus on process.
P.S Love you
